# **App Name**: Realtime Chat

## Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Core Features

- User Authentication: Secure user authentication via email/password, powered by Firebase Auth.
- Realtime Chat: Send and receive text messages in real time.
- Chat Room: Join multiple people inside one single room.
- Message Formatting Tool: Use an AI powered formatting tool that lets users generate fancy messages, like applying italics or underline certain keywords and highlight important sections. The tool helps determine which parts of a message will benefit the most from added emphasis, to clarify and add impact. The tool will use reasoning to decide if some piece of information is to be incorporated in its output.
- User Avatars: Choose a default avatar. Every registered user may be assigned a placeholder.
- Read Status: See visual confirmation when a message has been seen.

## Style Guidelines

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#00BFFF) for a vibrant, modern feel.
- Background color: Light grayish-blue (#E6F7FF) to complement the primary.
- Accent color: Salmon pink (#FA8072) to highlight user actions, adding a personal touch.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif for a clean and contemporary interface.
- Use minimalist icons for message status and navigation.
- Clean and intuitive layout to highlight readability. Left aligned messages from others, and right aligned messages from current user.
- Subtle transitions for sending/receiving messages and changes.
